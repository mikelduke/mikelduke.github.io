<p>It has been quite awhile since the last update, but I have a ton of new photos and am now sorting through them. Hopefully, I will get some more photos up soon. I have built a new pc and hope to get a new version of Adobe Lightroom soon.</p>
<p>I am still living in Dallas, TX and working as a Programmer doing lots of Javascript/Java/SQL type web stuff. It's pretty neat.</p>
<p>I also joined the<a title="Dallas Makerspace" href="https://dallasmakerspace.org/" target="_blank"> Dallas Makerspace</a> a few months back, it is a great place.</p>
