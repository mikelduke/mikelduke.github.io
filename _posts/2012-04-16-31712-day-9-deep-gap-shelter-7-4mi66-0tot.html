<p>Finally an easier day of hiking. Made great time, even catching up with Slim at Addis Gap. Kelly Knob was still super tough to go up, at 900ft of gain over about 1mi.</p>
<p>Got in to the shelter about 2pm. A-Team, Jason, Shiann, Slim, and a group of Boy Scouts from Alabama are all here. They seem to be a pretty good bunch, and are on the trip here for three days as prep for Philmont. They should have a great time.</p>
<p>Got to get up early tomorrow about 5am to hike 4mi out and catch a shuttle at Dick's Creek Gap at 9am. We have a room reserved at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee. Should be a nice break. Happy St. Paddy's Day.</p>
