<p>I redid everything and moved my site to Wordpress. Hopefully, it'll be nicer. I just decided I didn't want to go and make a lot of stuff when it already does it. The photos don't link to flickr anymore and instead popup to a larger version. Flickr was just too slow when I had several photos on a page.</p>

<p>I'm working on adding a gallery with a store from Fotomoto, so people can order prints. Hopefully it'll go well, and sell bunches.</p>
