<p>My initial itinerary has me doing the approach trail and getting in to Neel's Gap for a resupply on day five. For most it is a four day hike if the approach trail is included, but I do not want a 15 mile day up and down Blood Mountain. There are also reports of bear problems around Blood Mountain, which means bear cans are being required to camp near there. So the options are to buy an expensive bear can to use for just one night, or to skip the area by stopping short and hiking through the next day, as I intend to.</p>
