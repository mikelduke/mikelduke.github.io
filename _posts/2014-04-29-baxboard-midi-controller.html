<p>I put together a Midi Controller over the last few days using the<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trellis-diy-open-source-led-keypad/overview" target="_blank"> 4 Trellis button pads I ordered from Adafruit</a>. I decided to add&nbsp;4 knobs, four buttons, an lcd, a joystick, midi, and power led to the four pads and went to work making a panel that I could laser cut at the <a href="https://dallasmakerspace.org" target="_blank">Dallas Makerspace</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't been using any guides or anything, just making it up as I go along. I started with just a few pieces on a breadboard and that worked well, so I thought I would make it more permanent; it is a lot easier to move&nbsp;this way. This does have the unfortunate side effect of creating a big mess of wires behind that front panel. Maybe on the next version I'll take the time to design a real PCB. I was looking at parts online, and it could be a lot smaller and easier to build using all through-hole knobs, buttons, and connectors instead of panel mount. At least this way, I got something to work with a lot faster and was able to use&nbsp;what I had.</p>
<p>I laser cut just three parts for this build. I didn't go with a complete box, instead I just cut front and rear panels, and a piece that backs up on to the buttons to hold them securely against the panel.&nbsp;It is about 2.5" tall, but I spaced the boards apart using bolts and extra nuts.&nbsp;I will probably try and figure out something better for any future versions.</p>
<p>Amanda came up with a great name for it, baxboard. I think I'll use that.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mikelduke" target="_blank">I have also began to put some code on Github</a>. I have&nbsp;quite a bit of code&nbsp;I always intended to put up online, but never really got around to it. I made an account last year when working on the RFID Interlock and uploaded that code to the DMS repo, but never put any of my own up. I have used SVN for several years and it's been great running my own server, but it is not too conducive to public sharing, Github makes this easier.</p>
<p>I posted all the code for&nbsp;my Led Table Coffee Table; Arduino sketch, php script, mysql script, and Raspberry Pi Java app. I usually mark everything as GPLv2 in case&nbsp;anyone is interested in using it.</p>
<p>I will be putting the <a href="https://github.com/mikelduke/baxboard" target="_blank">source code and laser cut images for baxboard&nbsp;up on Github</a> as I go along and get to&nbsp;functional places.</p>
