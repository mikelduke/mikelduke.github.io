<p>The Dallas Makerspace had an open house on Saturday. It was really fun and I had a chance to show off a couple of my projects. I took the trash guitar I built using an old speaker cone and an axe handle, the Baxboard, the Arduino Midi Sythesizer, a homemade amp, homemade tube screamer clone pedal, and a Raspberry Pi running the JAMS app which was setup with&nbsp;my keyboard and Baxboard.</p>
<p>There was also a pinball room set up with many of the pinball tables&nbsp;some of the member have restored. This was definitely a hit.</p>
