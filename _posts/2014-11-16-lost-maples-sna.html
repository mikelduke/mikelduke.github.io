<p>Last Weekend I went backpacking out at Lost Maples State Natural Area near Vanderpool, TX with my girlfriend Amanda. We had a great time and the park was pretty awesome. It is not very big, and certainly seemed crowded.</p>
<p>I created this video using some clips I took on my new Panasonic Lumix TS5, which I got to replace my TS3 since it developed a leak, and a Galaxy Note 3 cellphone. The song came off of Youtube's section of free songs for soundtracks.</p>
