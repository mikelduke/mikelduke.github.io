<p>Been in Dallas the last few days. My family likes to go out to eat a lot, for pretty much every meal. We have done that quite a bit. Not much else, but playing with the dogs.</p>
<p>I have moved all my stuff in to the house and have it sitting in a pretty decent pile. Most of it all fit on the floor between my old bed, a dresser, and my parents junk. It's crowded, but that's not a problem, it's just a few days.</p>
