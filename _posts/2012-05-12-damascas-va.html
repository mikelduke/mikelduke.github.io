<p>I got in to Damascas, VA yesterday afternoon, and immediately sat down to a order a large calzone at Quinceys the local pizza place. Got a new backpack yesterday, a ULA Catalyst weighing several pounds less. I have lots of journal stuff to type up if I ever find a computer for it.</p>
<p>466 miles down and a whole bunch more to go.</p>
