I decided to get rid of the old wordpress backed site and convert to a new one using Jekyll. The new page 
should be faster since it will be statically built instead of dynamic.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a Ruby based static website builder. Instead of requiring a database to store content and 
retrieving it on every page load, Jekyll uses templates and markdown to let you build a site
that is static so it requires no database and uses much less resources. [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) use 
Jekll for projects hosted on their site so there are lots of resources available.
