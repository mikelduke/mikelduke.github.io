<p>Couldn't sleep much last night as expected. Woke up, ate oatmeal with trail mix and pop tarts. Tuna and crackers and nutella tortillas for lunch. Ramen with a pack of salmon, garlic and crackers for dinner, was pretty good.</p>
<p>Tough day, ready for it to be over, but it kept on going. Sassaffras was steep and tough. Going up is tiring, going down is more painful.</p>
<p>Meeting some cool people. I go slow so they usually pass me up after a few and meet them at a shelter later.</p>
<p>I want to go to bed early since I am tired and it is dark, but that means about twelve hours of laying here until it is light enough in the morning.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be going to Lance Creek. I think it is the last campsite before the area with bear problems where bear cans are required.</p>
