This week has been pretty busy. I had to move out of my apartment and drag all my junk back to Dallas.
Most of it I was able to just throw out. I tried to give away most of my furniture, but even though people 
would want it, they never came to get it. Someone did get off with a couple dumpster surprises though, 
since most of it was picked up fairly quickly.

I had to run several errands around town before I could finally leave. The best was going to the bank, which 
is probably the first and last time that will ever be said. I had been saving all my change for the last 
few years in a large 5 gallon Ozarka water jug. I thought it might be a good time to finally go and cash 
it all in. The jug was only half full, but was getting heavy and I did not want to have to move it again.

At the bank, a couple of the customer service guy were watching and said they hadn't seen a jar like this for 
awhile and were trying to guess the amount, 680 or 750. One had to stand by with a key to keep restarting the 
machine, since it has problems with large amounts of change. It still went pretty fast. In the end, it came 
out to about 700 bucks. I left the jug with the guy who seemed interested in doing something similar.

The night I went out with Steve and his family to the Atami Steakhouse. I had never been before, because I am 
not a fan of Asian food. It's all kinda gross and noodly. I went and tried it anyway, as he said it's mostly 
steak and stuff. It turned out to be pretty good. They cook it all on a grill right in front of ya with lots 
of fire and throwing things around. Definitely a good place, and a good time.
