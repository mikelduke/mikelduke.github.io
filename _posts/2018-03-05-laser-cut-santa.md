In December, I made a laser cut stained wood Santa piece for a Christmas gift. I always have to wait to
publish anything about gifts, and tend to wait too long.

I drew the image in Inkscape and laser cut it as a series of small shapes, stained each piece, 
glued them together and made a frame out of popular.

I think it turned out pretty well and like the 3d effect of the wood glued on top of other pieces.
