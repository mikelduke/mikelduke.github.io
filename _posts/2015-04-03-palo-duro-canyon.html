<p>Last week was my 30th birthday. To celebrate, Amanda and I went on a camping trip for over a week around NW Texas. We camped at Palo Duro Canyon, Caprock Canyon, and Possum Kingdom. We had a great time, and her parents even came out to Possum Kingdom to camp and celebrate. We had some awesome chili cheeseburgers with Fritos and a very good cookie cake.</p>
<p>This is the first video I have made, and hope to have more featuring the other parks soon.</p>
