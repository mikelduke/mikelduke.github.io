<p>The Roan Highlands in the Northern part of TN was one of the nicest sections so far. After a long 2700ft climb up to the top of Roan High Knob, the trail follows a ridgeline for many miles and goes over the top of several bald mountains. Roan High Knob Shelter is the highest shelter on the AT and looks like an old cabin, but other than a spruce forest there are no nice views. A few miles after though, the trail crossed a road at Carver's Gap and everything changed.</p>

<p>Jane Bald, Round Bald, Grassy Ridge Bald, Little Hump, and Hump Mountain were great. Few trees, nice trail, and views off in all directions down the valleys. I stayed at Overmountain Shelter next, an old barn converted for hikers. I'd say it is one of the coolest shelters.</p>
