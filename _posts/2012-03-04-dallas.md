Been in Dallas the last few days. My family likes to go out to eat a lot, for pretty much every 
meal. We have done that quite a bit. Not much else, but playing with the dogs.

I have moved all my stuff in to the house and have it sitting in a pretty decent pile. 
Most of it all fit on the floor between my old bed, a dresser, and my parents junk. It's 
crowded, but that's not a problem, it's just a few days.
