<p>Amanda and I went camping with her parents at Garner State Park. This park was pretty nice. I think we were at the older part, but&nbsp;in the last few years has grown quite a bit.&nbsp;Even so, it still fills up quickly and reservations must be made a ways in advance. The river was very&nbsp;fun to play in and wasn't even cold.</p>
