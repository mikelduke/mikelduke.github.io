<p>I got back home a couple weeks ago. I hiked from GA-MA, getting off the trail just a few miles in to Massachusetts. All told I was on the trail about five and a half months and did a little over 1500 miles. I hope to go back when I get some more time and money, maybe next summer or the year after, or maybe go ride my bike. After that long, I was just tired of hiking.</p>
<p>I have a ton of photos to sort, but I have slowly been getting through them. I want to update some on NJ, NY, and CT in the next few days, and then probably stick some of the best shots up as I work on them.</p>
