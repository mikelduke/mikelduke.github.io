<p>While staying at the RV Park in Lajitas, TX we drove down the scenic Highway 170 a couple times. After seeing several horses on the Mexican side of the border, we crested one of the larger mountain passes on the road and started down to this view on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Mexico is to the left.</p>
<p>The view was reminiscent of the Headwaters of the Rio Grande I stopped at along a highway in Colorado, seen below.</p>
