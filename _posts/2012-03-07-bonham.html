<p>I went up to Bonham, TX the last couple days to visit with my dad and his wife Belinda before I leave town. It was a nice visit. I saw his animals. He has a large pig, of about 250lbs that he is planning to slaughter on Friday, and also a few turkeys. He had more turkeys and some chickens, but they have slowly been eaten by things. Most likely coyotes or maybe even owls lately.</p>

<p>While there we also went out and saw John, a friend of his. He lives out at a cool piece of property with lots of nice woods. He has a tree farm and a cool old cabin his dad once lived in. We wandered around the woods for a little bit and saw plenty of red oak and cedar trees. It was a pretty nice place, very different from the other farms around where all their land has been clear cut into boring fields and giant lawns.[gallery link="file" columns="4"]</p>
