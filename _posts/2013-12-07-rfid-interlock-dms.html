<p>Last December I joined the Dallas Makerspace. It is an awesome place where people are welcome to work on a variety of projects. The space also owns many tools that most people would not normally have access to; some of these require training.</p>
<p>In order to enforce this, we have been working on an RFID based power interlock that we can build and use to only connect the power for approved users.</p>
<p>I have made some progress in writing the code in Java for a BeagleBone Black board running Angstrom Linux, and created a demo video.</p>
