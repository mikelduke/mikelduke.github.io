<p>This is a test running the Midi out example code that is included with the Arduino IDE. It can be found under File - Examples - 04. Communication - MIDI.</p>
<p>Details on how to connect the Midi connector are <a href="https://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Midi?from=Tutorial.MIDI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I like the versatility of having separate components, the Midi producing Arduino, the Midi synth, and then the amp. I want to keep the parts interchangeable. I can hook my Synthesizer up to the PC and run midi to it, but I could also hook up the other arduino to a different synthesizer or the pc.</p>
<p>I want to make a box of buttons to use for midi input to the synthesizer. I am thinking of an 8x8 matrix of light up buttons, and then at least 4 knobs. I want it to be able to do standard midi out so I could try connecting to different things. I'm thinking I want to mess with the knobs, then hit a set button and map the current settings to one of the buttons in the matrix, but this could change if I come up with a better idea.</p>
