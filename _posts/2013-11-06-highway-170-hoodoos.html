<p>This was shot from just off of Highway 170 by Big Bend Ranch State Park. There is a parking lot with a couple short trails going to an overlook and then down to the Rio Grande. The site was called <a title="Hoodoos" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)" target="_blank">Hoodoos</a>&nbsp;after the exposed rocks.</p>
