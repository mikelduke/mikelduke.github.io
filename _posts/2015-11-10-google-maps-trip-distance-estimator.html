I recently went on a Bike Tour from May to August and biked from just outside of Dallas, TX to western Oregon near Eugene.</p>
<p>On my trip I wanted an easier way to try and plan out a route and pick the next few towns to hit, so I made one.</p>
<p>This uses google maps and places a marker with circles around it to make it easier to gauge distances. I found this to be a little bit of a pain due to the lack of a scale on the regular google map.</p>
<p>As you place markers, a straight line path is drawn and the straight distance is calculated. Then you can click "get directions" in the top right to have Google find a route and sum up the real distances between markers.</p>
<p>I would have used this by setting the radius to 40-50 miles, and 2-3 circles to judge the next series of towns I would try for over the next few days. Then I would use the route button to verify the actual distances, to make sure I wasn't skipping a section with no reasonable road between the towns. Finally, when I was to ride one of the segments, I would use a regular route finding app instead.</p>
<p>I think this would be a little bit easier than what I was doing in the past, which was mostly guessing and getting directions repeatedly just to find the mileages.</p>
<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/mikelduke/TripDistanceEstimator">Github</a> if anyone is interested. It is only an html file + javascript. You can easily download it and run without a webhost but an internet connection is required due to the use of Google services.</p>
<p>You can find it here, <a href="https://www.mikelduke.com/TripDistanceEstimator/" target="_blank">Google Maps Trip Distance Estimator</a> but if it's popular I will probably get a domain name for it.</p>
