After my last day of work, I drove out to Austin to see Amanda again. It was pretty fun, Austin is a great 
town. We went out to eat a couple times, going to [Trudy's](https://www.trudys.com/) and 
[BJ's Brewhouse](https://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/). Trudy's is a good place and I had a pretty awesome stuffed 
avocado. It is a fried avocado stuffed with chicken and peppers and who knows what else. BJ's is a good 
place for deep dish pizza, but a little on the pricey side.

While there, we drove out to [Cabela's](https://www.cabelas.com/) so I could get a few more needed 
things for my trip, mostly clothes and a pair of rain pants. I decided to go with a pair of 
[Frogg Toggs](https://www.froggtoggs.com/) after hearing good things on the [Whiteblaze](https://whiteblaze.net) 
backpacking forums. They were only $20 which was a great surprise, I was expecting about $50-100. The 
rain pants are said to be waterproof and breathable, but don't feel like it, instead they feel like 
some kind of odd paper. I hope they will work out, but mostly I hope that it doesn't rain much. Rainy 
hiking sucks.

We also went out to the [Alamo Drafthouse](https://drafthouse.com) to get dinner and see the movie 
[Rampart](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640548/). It was different kind of bad cop movie than most, 
but worth watching. Pretty intense at parts.

On Sunday, we went out to Walnut Creek Park again. It's a nice park with mountain bike trails, 
where dogs can be off leash the whole time. Giant Bikes had a demo day that morning, but we missed it.
