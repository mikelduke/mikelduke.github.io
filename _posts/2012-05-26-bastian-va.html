<p>Made it in to Bastian, VA mile 587 today and am staying at a local dojo, run by TrueBrit a great guy from well Britain.</p>
<p>Trail Days was fun, but was getting old towards the end and I was definitely ready to leave by the end. Tent city was awesome with thousands of hikers camped in the woods. The vendor area was kind of bland with a few gear companies, but lots of people selling junk knick knacks or fair food.</p>
<p>Also I finally crossed the 25% mark. Only another 1600+ miles to go now.</p>
