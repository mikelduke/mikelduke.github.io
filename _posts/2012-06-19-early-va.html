<p>Got to Waynesboro, VA today and have access to a pc so photos are going up.</p>

<p>I hiked into Damascas southbound after taking a shuttle north to Fox Creek with Maps, DR, and Smitter. The Greyson Highlands were pretty awesome with wild ponies that followed us around and tried to take out food.</p>
<p>Trail Days back in May was fun with lots of hikers and other people. Tent City was the best, with lots of camping. I set up in the woods near the bonfire area. Camp Riff Raff, one of the largest groups, even had a wedding in the woods, and a bluegrass band play afterwards.</p>

<p>At Trail Days, I met AWOL who had a booth in the vendor area. He is the author of my guidebook, The AT Guide. I also met a guy planning to ride the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route on a unicycle through the mountains from Canada to Mexico.[gallery link="file" columns="5" orderby="post_date"]</p>
