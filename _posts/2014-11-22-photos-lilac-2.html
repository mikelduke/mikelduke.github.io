<p><a href="https://mikelduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1070825.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-532" src="https://mikelduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1070825-1024x592.jpg" alt="Lilac Tree" width="950" height="549" /></a>Amanda and I went camping out at her parent's place in May. Lots of the family came out and we had a good time.&nbsp;These photos are mostly from a short walk through the field to go shoot some skeet. Apparently I can shoot quite well, though I never thought so before. I guess my friends I shot with before weren't just ok, they were&nbsp;really&nbsp;good.</p>
