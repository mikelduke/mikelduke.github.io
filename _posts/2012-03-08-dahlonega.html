<p>I just got in to Dahlonega and the weather is pretty nice right now. The people at the hostel are all laid back too. The place is a three story log cabin just up in the mountains a little. Lots of oak and pine trees. No snow, good thing I guess. I leave to start hiking tomorrow. I asked and jason was dropped off at the approach trail yesterday morning. I am still unsure whether to start there or just go straight to Springer and start the trail. I'll find out tomorrow.[gallery link="file" columns="4" orderby="post_date"]</p>
