<p><a href="https://mikelduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2012-08-12-14.07.11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-205" title="New York Rock Ladder" src="https://mikelduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2012-08-12-14.07.11-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a> New York Rock Ladder</p>
<p>New York was unexpectedly tough. I later found out many people call it "Little New Hampshire." The profile wasn't all that different from New Jersey, but it was ridiculous. Lots of small 10-20ft climbs, straight up rock faces. It changed instantly upon crossing the border. It was nice to eventually start getting in to the mountains again, as the elevation slowly climbs.</p>

<p>New York and New Jersey have great food. I called it the land of pizza and sandwiches, coincidentally, they happen to be two of my favorite things. There are delis frequently along the trail. Luckily the delis are within a couple miles, because unlike the rest of the AT, hitchhiking is prohibited and enforced.</p>
<p>I spent a couple days at a place called Graymoore Spritual Center. It is a rehab center and friary right on the trail, that has built a great little pavilion and they invite hikers to come camp there. They have a shower, water, and even electricity. Unfortunately, while I was here one of my tent poles snapped. I called TarpTent and the owner Henry Shires mailed some out as quick as possible. I was able to get two replacement sections, and a bit of scrap fabric to repair my tent a couple days later. It was an easy fix. Thanks TarpTent for the quick service.</p>

<p>I had a problem with my shoulder strap on my pack tearing off. It tore halfway across, but I called ULA and they shipped one out to me to use while I mailed mine in for repair. I got it in Stormville, NY.</p>
<p>I found out there was a local pizza place another half-mile up the road. I figured I didn't walk all the way to the Post Office to miss out on pizza. They had huge slices for about $3. There was a little bar next door I thought I'd go to. I wanted to put off leaving for a little while, since it was 2.5 mi back to the trail and another 5 to camp, and was hoping to find a ride too if I was lucky. I met a nice guy Frank. He offered me a ride back to a place closer to Pawling, NY, where I needed to be the next morning. Frank ends up inviting me to stay at his place when it looks like rain might be coming. I had a great time with him and his family. I just want to say thanks.</p>

<p>One of the coolest campsites I had was on Black Mountain, just a few miles south of Bear Mountain, NY. I camped right at the top and had a great view down to the Hudson River. In the morning, I could even make out the NYC skyline way out on the horizon, supposedly 34 miles away. I was woken up about 2am by a horrendous storm. Non-stop lightning, heavy rain and wind. This was probably the only time I was really scared on the whole trip. The lightning was constant, close, and very bright, while I was camped on a rocky spot at the top of the mountain, with nothing tall around leaving me very exposed. It eventually passed, but not before I missed out on a lot of sleep.</p>
