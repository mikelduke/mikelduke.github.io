<p><a href="https://mikelduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1070661.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-495" src="https://mikelduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1070661-1024x768.jpg" alt="Pedernales Falls State Park" width="950" height="712" /></a>I went to Pedernales Falls State Park with Amanda and her family back in March. It was tons of fun. The river is pretty neat, it's rocky, clear, and cool. The falls were just barely flowing after such a dry year. The weather turned out to be pretty nice. We had expected rain, but luckily it never came.</p>
