<p>Next to the part of the RV park we stayed at in Lajitas, TX were a couple of big hills on the way to the tenting area.</p>
<p>This one was pretty steep and very narrow at the top. It seemed to be made up of only dried mud, so I guess it will wash away some day. It was just barely wide enough to walk on, but very crumbly so I didn't go far.</p>
